            <p class="description-door">Automatic Door Opening System is a simple automated system, where the door is automatically opened up on detecting a person and automatically closes after some time.
                The principle of the project lies in the functioning of the PIR Sensor. A PIR or Passive Infra-red Sensor, as the name indicates, doesnâ€™t emit infrared rays but only detects them.

All humans emit infrared radiations in the form of body heat. A PIR Sensor will capture the difference between the room temperature and body temperature in the form of change in infrared radiation.

This change in infrared pattern is converted to a voltage. The voltage from the Data Out of the PIR Sensor can be given to a microcontroller for further processing like controlling a motor etc.

            <img class="solar-image" src="solar-image.png">
            <p class="description-door">The designed project track the sun to achieve the maximum sun light incident on the solar panel during anytime of the day. The system requires a solar panel coupled with a stepping motor to keep tracking the sun and moving according to the maximum sun light received.
                The solar panel that can rotate in two axis automatically using four light sensors, and the controller used hear is arduino uno.
                When sunlight incident on the solar tracker. it starts calculating and comparing that from which direction the maximum intensity sunlight is coming.

                after comparing the panel above the system start to move toward the maximum intensity so that the solar panel has the maximum intensity and makes the maximum power.

            <img class="vehicle-image" src="vehicle-image.jpg">
            <p class="description-door">vehicular pollution monitoring system which is capable of detecting vehicles causing pollution on the
                city roads and measures pollutant level in air. The Vehicle is automatically
                identified by using RFID system, we can get the vehicle owner details and then
                measures the level of emission from vehicle. Gas sensor is used for measure the amount of pollutants present in the smoke
                from the vehicle. If the polutans amount is greater then the threshold level,the vehicle is concidered as making pollution and GSM Module sent a message to
                owner informing that his vehicle leads to pollution and the penalty is to be
                paid.

            <p class="description-door">Pick and place robots enable companies to use automated solutions for lifting objects from one location and placing them at other locations.
                It is 4 wheeled robot and it can be controlled by using a mobile application wirelessly.
                The coolest feature of this robot is that, it can do repeated tasks automatically if once we direct it to do the required task. We can also change the task whenever we want.
